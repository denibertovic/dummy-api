## Dummy API for testing out frontend frameworks

This is a Kanban like API that is envisioned to be used as a more "real worldy" example for testing
out frontend frameworks (more real-world than a todo app that is).

Currently there are not frontend implementations but will be added soon.

`NOTE`: The API is envisioned to be run within a docker container (for easier portability) but
you are free to build the project locally (using stack) and run the generated binary.

`NOTE 2`: Currently there is not authentication built into the API. Every resource is
publicly available.

## How to run
